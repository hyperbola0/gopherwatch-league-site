<p>Hiya everyone! Sorry if I tricked you into thinking the player stats were up. I've got a small cool update (well, a reveal of the cool update I put in a week ago)!</p>
<p>Late last Tuesday, I added some code to track when people are accessing the website. This info was fed into a google sheet by both the time of day, and the day of the week. Now that it's been a week, I figured I would throw up the results if any stats nerds are interested.</p>
<h4>Page hits by day of week</h4>

<p>As you can see, Thursday and Monday had the most access to the website, with 319 and 245 pages accessed, respectively. This corresponds to the #1 Galapagos Gremlins seed's game and the then-#2 London Lumberjack Slams games. I'm interested to see if the days begin to even out as we collect more data, or if they will skew towards game days.</p>

<p>It is noticable that the most page hits tend to be at on the hour, which could correspond to the match start times as viewers load the site to check the standings and matches. The website's most active hours tend to be between 7pm and 11:30pm. Surprisingly enough there have been no night owls looking at the page between 3am and 7am so far!</p>
