<p>Hello and welcome to the latest feature update of the website, the first release of the stat tracker! It must be said that this could not have happened without the help of BOON1E (our dear commissioner and Galapagos Gremlins star), who set up the Workshop lobby to track stats and developed the program that uploads these stats to the website. I'd also like to thanks the admins and occasionally captains that volunteer to run the lobby and collect the log files for us. This wouldn't be possible without your work!</p>

<p>The <a href="/Stats/">Stats page</a> now shows the stats for all players based on hero pick. You can select a hero using the dropdown menu above the stats table (Box 1). Each entry includes a player's name, their eliminations, final blows, damage, and deaths per 10 minutes. In addition, supports have a healing done stat and tanks have a damage blocked stat. The time played in minutes is also shown. The cumulative number behind each stat can be seen by hovering your mouse over the cell.</p>

<p>Each statistic can also be sorted by clicking on the header of the row (Box 2). Player and team names are sorted alphabetically, and numerical stats are sorted from top to bottom. In addition, clicking again will show the stat sorted in opposite order (reverse alphabetically, or from least to most).</p>

<p>There are some discrepancies between the web server and the app that make it difficult to connect the players to the teams. The server uses a full battletag (for example, hyperbola0#1499) to connect a player with a team, while the stats uploaded does not include the numbers. This will be worked out in a future update, but for now the player's team is not displayed in stats, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This is brand new and there are sure to be bugs, so be sure to use the bug reporter located in the navigation bar at the top of the page!</p>
