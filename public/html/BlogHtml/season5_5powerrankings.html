<p>Hello Gopherwatch League, the blog is back! This season the blog will hopefully be updated weekly with new content, and a new staff, featuring the return of RustyGoomba, with RiddleDog, YeetMeister, and myself, Nuttyr. In addition to rolling out an updated power rankings after every week, we will post a weekly recap to give a short summary of each match, for those of you who didn’t watch each match but want to stay up to date with the league. With the weekly recap, we will also be adding a new bit called Team of the Week. This will feature 7 players from the past week of matches who put on an impactful and outstanding performance. It will be split into 2 tanks, 2 dps, 2 supports, and one extra slot for a substitute of any role. It will not be broken down into sub roles, so 2 main tanks or 2 hitscans can make the same team of the week. Instead of simply selecting who we think are the best players at each position like All Pro, we will be looking for players who outperformed expectations, made game-winning plays, or made key contributions to a win, even if only for a map.</p>
<p>Since this is the return of the blog, and we haven’t had a blog post since season 4 before the midseason tournament, when poor Rusty had to do it all by himself, let's give a quick recap of the events that have transpired since, in seasons 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Going into the midseason tournament, the Pompeii Pelicans were an undefeated 5-0, but lost to the USSR Unicorns 2-0. The Galactic Water Bears defeated the Highland Hydro Homies 2-0, and went on to defeat the Unicorns in the finals in a thrilling 3-2 reverse sweep. The Pelicans got their revenge later, as the grand finals featured the 1st seed Water Bears vs the 2nd seed Pelicans. The Pelicans won in 6 maps, and Invictus took home the Finals MVP award, along with his second championship title. FlamboJambo took home the Season 4 MVP award for his work in turning around the Fennecs lackluster start to a 3rd seed finish.</p>
<p>In season 5, we saw the first ever undefeated regular season, as the St. Michael Hawks went 6-0, only dropping 3 maps all season. The Rialto Ringers managed to figure them out in the playoffs, and sent them home in a 5 map thriller to face the red hot Kanto Cantaloupes in the finals. The Ringers put up a good fight, fighting off elimination in map 4 to end an astounding 24 map win streak that the Cantaloupes had since their week 1 defeat to the Hawks, but in the end, Kanto took home the trophy in 5 maps, with Corey winning his second championship trophy and first finals MVP. Fancy won the Season 5 MVP, as a dominant force on the Hawks on multiple off tank characters. Finally, at the end of season 5, BOON1E stepped down as commissioner, with Makkr0 taking over the spot, and Frobel, Flipflop, and Oks were inducted into the GWL Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>On to the main event, preseason power rankings, you know, the definitive list after seeing nothing but their rosters after one day. Honestly, this draft looks to have made one of the more balanced leagues we have seen up to this point, as for almost every team on the list, including our bottom 3 teams, there were multiple people arguing for their placement as a top tier team, and that just goes to show how unpredictable this season might be, and just how close of competition these teams will be for each other. I’m not sure exactly how many, but this list took input from roughly 15 separate staff members at one point or another, so just remember, if your team was ranked low, it is somebody else’s fault. We did our best to predict what roles people would be playing, but we may have gotten a few wrong. Again, this is all purely speculation, so take this list with a grain of salt. As the Kanto Cantaloupes proved, early weeks don’t really matter, as teams are still figuring things out. With that, let's start with our #1…</p>

<h3>1: Awesome Anglers</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/anglers_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>We simply cannot rank Bonezee’s team anything below the top spot. Not only is Bonezee coming off a championship season on the nigh unstoppable Kanto Cantaloupes, winning his second title in only 4 seasons, but the team he drafted around himself looks very solid. BOON1E, who simply refuses to not make the all pro lineup, gives lots of comp flexibility on the main tank role. The team is also filled with many value for sr picks like the reigning Most Improved Kirbology, or the impressive rookie season from Sonicronic, or Warmest Bench MightyDwarf. In addition to that, he found two very good diamond flex supports in Emiro and Zelos to round out the roster. Until somebody can prove that Bonezee is mortal, the Anglers will rest atop our power rankings. </p><p>~ Nuttyr</p>

<h3>2: Dorado Ducks</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/ducks_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>Looking at the Ducks, it would be difficult to argue that this team shouldn’t theoretically be a big force to be reckoned with this season. Last season, Frobel was very difficult to stop on heroes like Roadhog, Dva, and Zarya when he regularly played them on the Axolotls. With Nyamonya coming off of Season 5, going to the grand finals and claiming the Rookie of the Year award after playing characters like Junkrat, Echo, and his signature Genji. Poke1236ok who recently peaked 3600 on main tank after going to the grand finals with Nyamonya by playing Reinhardt and his noteworthy Winston. FlipFlop is known to be one of the best Flex Supports in the whole league with her constant moments of glory on characters like Ana. After an unfortunate season with the Kittens and the Huhns, Lostsilver is looking to redeem himself as a notable and really high value Flex and Main Support player that may even have the chance to show his stuff on DPS. Kabr27 on DPS will be a wildcard to say the least, as he only played DPS for one map last season which his team did win. He is known to play Hanzo along with some Doomfist with Akua as a mentor, which could turn out to be very dangerous. Lol247 is also looking to make a bigger name for himself on Main Tank after playing the role very very well last season on the Honolulu Hamsters.</p>

<h3>3: Iceland Imps</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/imps_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>Ranking 3rd are The Iceland Imps which have few weak points.Their captain Trey taking the mantle as Main tank also having the unproven Nashbrowns at his side on the off tank. I’m sure that this tank line with some scrim time could grow to be quite good. The Imps also arguably have one of the strongest DPS lines in the league starring Invictus, who holds two championships under his belt being a very dominant hitscan player. Filling in Invictus’s weak points is FedoraMaster, being known for his performance on most projectile based heroes, notably Torbjorn. FedoraMaster also played on teams with Trey inside and outside of the league which will build team cohesion heavily. Adding even more team play the Imps have War, the most positive (Aspiring) Villain in the league most likely pocketing Invictus similarly to what we saw on the Hawks in the previous season. Rounding out the Iceland Imps support line is Sly bringing several All-Pro Awards on flex support with Charbotron being another PMA player known for main support. We are sure this team will hold strong but are excited to see if the Iceland Imps can go above and beyond our expectations.</p>

<h3>4: Phiji Phrogs</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/phrogs_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>The Phiji Phrogs seem to be a perfect gatekeeper with many possible pop-off moments. Looking at this team, with the players it has, it should thrive on chaos and the enemy team not knowing what to do. Wags, Mr. Trivia Master himself, is known for many characters including Doomfist along with his stellar Roadhog. When paired with Phrog, the highest SR player in the league and the Lucio extraordinaire, they arguably become of the the deadliest duos in the entire league. After a great season on the Axolotls, both Phroodles and MuffinLumps will accompany each other on the Phrogs! Phroodles is known by many to be a very valuable player for his SR by playing most DPS characters in the game. He also went to the finals of the Season 5 Widow 1v1 against Invictus after beating akua and Trey. On the Phrogs, it would not be surprising to see MuffinLumps take the role of Flex Support as his Lucio will probably be taken by Phrog. Muffin has played Main Support for the most part in the league but he will be able to prove himself on Flex Support this season! Another high caliber player on the team is Whalefish, who is mainly known for his impressive gameplay on Hanzo and Genji. Whalefish is another player who is projected to pop off along with his teammates of the Phrogs. At long last, Nagaina is back on the Main Tank role, which he has not played since Season 4 on the Syndromes. He is looking to prove himself this season as a good well rounded tank that can hold his own, especially in this chaotic style that the team is expected to utilize. Another interesting player to watch this season is coolslime24. On the Hamsters last season coolslime mainly played Lucio, but with Phrog on the team, it will be interesting to see if he will run a Main or Flex Support with the Phrog Lucio. Another possibility would be that Phrog may swap to a Flex Support such as Ana or Baptiste with coolslime on a Main Support such as Lucio.</p>

<h3>5: Troubling Trout</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/trout_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>The Trout are a bit of a question mark in terms of projected performance, as they’re one of the teams possessing one of the few rookies in the league this year and it’s their highest SR player on the roster. The tankline of Orion and Liftkey should be a strong basis to make a strong amount of space for their comparatively weaker damage dealers in the captain of the Season 5 Champion Cantaloupes, RektCactus, and noted Reinhardt feeding specialist Yeet “Spacemaker” Meister slotting into the DPS Reinhardt charge the character. The Trout’s support line may be a bigger issue, as they’ll have to figure out their support rotation of ZUKINI, EJ!, and Bunny. I’m interested in seeing how the team is able to combine all of their players that are… “focusing” on their main characters. I think the team has great potential and I anticipate them to start slow and build up further as the season goes on, as many teams that rely on their tankline tend to do as the team figures out their structure, shotcalling, and strengths later as the season continues.</p>

<h3>6: Ema Skies</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/skies_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>Coming in at 6 is the Ema Skies. The only reason the team is this low is question marks on Fancy, the reigning MVP from the 1st seed Hawks, and their availability. Hvsek’s past three seasons have all ended in a number one seed at the end of the regular season, and now he looks to end his championship drought. The team is essentially a rehash of his previous 3 teams, with the addition of Jack, another very flexible player, and Resident, the rookie console player looking to make a name for themself, whose sr means the team can run Fancy and Akua on their main roles together, which is just terrifying to think about. This team easily has the potential to win the league. Akua, MVP runner up from season 4, brings a lot of flexibility with a GM sr on both tank and DPS. Wytherin, Hvsek’s teammate from both the Water Bears and Hawks, looks to run Lucio this time, with Razz on her main role of Ana, bringing back the Hawks support line, with flipped roles. When Fancy isn’t there, former champion Ninjadrew will get to play their main role of off tank, potentially learning from Fancy themself on their signature Hog character.</p>

<h3>7: Welsh Whales</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/whales_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>The Welsh Whales sit at number 7 having several new players to the league also going without tanks on paper. Assuming we see Corey and TheNortLogic tank line, Corey should be able to pick up the Main Tank role with ease with his vast games sense pairing well with TheNortLogic’s powerful and valuable D.va. GrigmaMale showed off his Genji mastery in the Hidden Gems Combine along with Spacemuffin’s Ana that we also saw. Paired together I think these rookies will prove to be strong together. Centurion also comes flying in off a nice win from Season 5, proving himself on Dps. From the Kantoluples Neopaladious joined Coreys roster being a promising Main Support. Filling out the roster no one can forget about Mainamoon’s performance from the axolotls last season, pulling off impressive mercy tech while still being on controller. We’re all excited to see their powerful plays on other supports!</p>

<h3>8: Pokhara Pusheens</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/pusheens_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>In PurpleJesus’ return to Overwatch, he finds himself playing with a lot of players that have a very high potential to be one of the best teams in the league, but have some experience issues that may restrain them from finding success during the season. Mikey didn’t have as great of a Season 5 as one would have expected from the former MVP on the Gorp Gamer Syndicate, but his previous experience shows that at any moment he can explode with carry potential. Nuttyr is moving back to the support role after a strong season as the St. Michael Hawks starting Main Tank, but his move to keyboard and mouse this season leaves question marks to where he actually lands SR-wise with a new mechanics switch and a new account as he still hasn’t fully settled in, though his experience as a higher SR console player should allow him to make up for possible mechanics questions with great gamesense. Nqthyn and Ribro have looked good in the past, but results from their previous teams are comparatively lacking for what I would have anticipated based on their gameplay. Frosty and Bronx should be solid support players to fill out the roster and this team has a chance to explode at some point in this season, but the recent experience and previous results have hindered their placement in the preseason power rankings.</p>

<h3>9: Arizona O-Teas</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/oteas_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>Another team with potentially very high upside, they are this low for a couple of reasons, flexibility and playtime. If Rohr can play main tank when needed, it will allow Jumbled to get in on DPS more easily, but I’m still unsure about how this support line will rotate play time effectively. Will Riddle swap to a different role? Does Strudel come out? These are things that the team will have to figure out in the coming weeks, but once they do, this team looks very solid. Rohr and RustyGoomba bring a lot of leadership and game knowledge to the team, and the team looks very balanced across all roles, especially when you look at how good this support line is compared to most teams. LumpySeal is making their DPS debut, and brings a lot of flexibility to the table, able to offrole if needed. Jumbled has proven themself to be worth more than their sr in the league, and has a lot of experience from past seasons, so they know how to play in an organized team effectively. WiggleHiggle is making their GWL debut, one of only 6 rookies in the league, and will be paired with either Riddle or Strudel when they come in, which is pretty good company. Finally the team is captained by the season 4 MVP FlamboJambo, whose calculated sr is lower than their recent peaks by quite a bit, and will look to make a good debut as captain for the O-Teas.</p>

<h3>10: Chicago Cats</h3>
<img src="/images/blog/cats_roles.png" class="blog-image-medium">
<p>I’m sure that my teammates from my first college team are going to not like this, but this team sits at the bottom of the first power rankings. I don’t actually think that this team is bad, but the team may actually be cursed to not win a game this season. The only times that PapaTriste played on a team where she wasn’t captain, it was with the winless Hamburg Huhns in Season 5, and with Cathect on the Buenos Aires Beebles in Season 2, which was one of the scariest teams at the end of the season that were unfortunately unable to close out matches one way or another. pAiGe (only time I’m capitalizing it like this) is primarily built her team around playing DPS this season, something that I have not seen and do not know how to comment on, but she has also been cursed with a winless South Korea Kittens last season following a cursed roster implosion halfway through the season. Oks has potential to be a 4.3k carry player on tank, but also a 3.4k player who is also on tank. Transflect has had success in previous seasons as a solid role player, not exactly a standout, but one cannot deny that his teams have been blessed with success as he was traded to the Season 4 Champion Pompeii Pelicans exclusively for their playoff run. Pushiin and Hyperbola0 are both helping fill out the support rotation, and this team should be able to be extremely flexible in their roster construction and look to have one of the top team environments in the league, so you could probably see them perform better than the power rankings would make them see as long as they can break this curse looming over them.</p>
