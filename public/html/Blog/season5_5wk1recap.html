<h1 class="center" style="color: maroon;">Match recaps</h1>

<h2>Pokhara Pusheens vs Welsh Whales : 3-1 Pusheens</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Lijiang Tower - Whales 2-0</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Pusheens pushed early, setting the tempo for the first half of Gardens to take an early 99/0 lead, and looked to close out round one with 2 picks in what should’ve been the final fight. Whales managed to stall long enough to flip Gardens, and took it all the way to 100 with their ult advantage.</li>
			<li>With both teams trading team kills on Control Center, the Whales’ better neutral game won them the map.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>King’s Row - Pusheens 3-2</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Pusheens started the map on attack and didn’t lose a teamfight. Some odd flanking in the Pusheens spawn led to Grigmamales getting picked early, and the Pusheens never took their foot off the gas pedal, finishing the round with a blistering 4:10 on the clock.</li>
			<li>Although Nort ate 2 graviton surges, the Whales stalled out in the place where timebanks go to die.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Watchpoint Gibraltar : Pusheens 2-0</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PurpleJesus and Corey, the captains, both swapped to Ashe with respective pockets for Gibraltar. Third point was hard for the Pusheens, as they got held there after entering with well over 3 minutes on the clock. </li>
			<li>The Whales got full held due to the harsh environment that is the end of first point Gibraltar.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Numbani : Pusheens 3-0</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PurpleJesus was now attacking on Wrecking Ball, not Winston, with Mikey on Echo. After capturing first point, the Pusheens cruised to a timebank of just under 3 minutes, and managed to nano a mercy in the mix. (Oops, my bad)</li>
			<li>The Pusheens swapped to an anti dive comp for defense, and the Whales couldn’t get much brewing against it, as it was very hard for the Whales to pick out a diveable target. A few ticks but no cap closed out the series.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ema Skies vs Troubling Trout : Skies 3-1</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Lijiang Tower : 2-1 Skies</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This was a back and forth affair. Various swaps made this one hard to follow as both teams tried changing things up for each map, as they learn how to play as a team. A swap from Jack from Monkey to Ball made a big difference on Gardens, and the Skies took it 2-1.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>King’s Row : 4-3 Trout</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Although the Skies full capped, their shorter timebank meant that they didn’t recapture the first point, while the Trout were able to capture with 3 seconds on the clock to win the map.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Rialto : 2-1 Skies </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Skies very nearly full held on Rialto, but with a big visor from RazzMaTazz on her offrole, they held the Trout on point 2 with room to spare.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Eichenwalde : 3-0 Skies</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Once Fancy swapped to off tank on Sigma and Roadhog, this team just hit differently. This match no longer felt close, and the team may have found their ideal comp. </li>
			<li>Bunny popped off on Ana, leading the lobby in healing as a controller player.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Iceland Imps vs Awesome Anglers : 3-0 Imps </h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Lijiang Tower : 2-0 Imps</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fedora’s turret seemed to cause problems for Bonezee on Echo, as the rest of the Imps rolled out on a 6 man comp with Torb for Gardens. </li>
			<li>Trey put in the work on Reinhardt for Control Center, and landed a 3-man window firestrike to seal the map.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>King’s Row : 3-1 Imps</p>
		<ul>
			<li>With Trey showing that he can play main tanks other than the dive based Winston and Hammond, King’s Row went smoothly for the Imps. Once again the Imps looked better in every facet, although the Anglers were able to coordinate ults well a few times to win some fights.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Route 66 : 3-0 Imps</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bonezee could not do more at this point in the match and swapped Hog. It didn’t work. Zeus was able to sleep or anti him enough with Nashbrowns all over him on D.Va, and the rest of the Anglers weren’t able to put the pieces together.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dorado Ducks vs Phiji Phrogs : 3-2 Ducks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Lijiang Tower : 2-0 Phrogs</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An early boop from Phrog onto the Ducks’ TP allowed early point control for the Phrogs which the Ducks struggled to contest.</li>
			<li>A 2K boop from Flipflop provided the Ducks with some room to breathe as they got their first point cap, but could not seem to keep the map in their favor. </li>
			<li>The Phrogs turn Gardens by stalling out the first fight until point progress reached 99-0. The Ducks did the same, making Gardens perhaps one of the sloppiest 99-99 maps of the week.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Hollywood : 4-3 Ducks</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Frobel decides he cannot do more and locks Roadhog for the remainder of the series</li>
			<li>The momentum favors the Ducks after their first point capture and they continue to set the tempo into a full capture with 3:30 to spare.</li>
			<li>Nyamonya’s ping is over 9000 as the Phrogs barely manage to cap third point, but the timebank is too far in the Ducks favor going into the final round.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Havana : 4-3 Ducks</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Ducks flex their Attack prowess, but cannot find their footing on defense, leading to the Phrogs capping with a considerable time margin.</li>
			<li>An upsetting C9 from five members of the Ducks somehow transforms into a heroic 4 minute first-point hold, despite Whalefish channeling his S3 Grand Finals self and popping off in OT. </li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Temple of Anubis : 4-3 Phrogs</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Both teams roll on attack but neither can figure out how to defend</li>
			<li>Phroodles with the Fleta deadlift in Round 4, finding 5 kills and being the first in the lobby to his ultimate, thanks in part to the reliable blue beam of MuffinLumps. </li>
			<li>“2cp moment”</li>
			<li>It’s C9 central for the Dorado Ducks</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Nepal : 2-1 Ducks</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Ducks open with a clean 99% hold in the first round, but lose point once and find themselves unable to kill Phrog.</li>
			<li>The Phrogs seem unable to decide which fights to take and which to give up, allowing for the Ducks to sneak in 100% point progress. </li>
			<li>Frobel goes on countless Roadhog adventures (some more fruitful than others) and finishes out the final round with a Whole Hog to prevent touches.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arizona O-Teas vs Chicago Cats : 3-2 O-Teas</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Lijiang Tower : 2-0 O-Teas</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A convincing win for the O-Teas to start the match. They took an early lead and looked to be more comfortable in close engagements, especially on Gardens. The Cats made some great individual plays but the O-Teas seemed to be more coordinated with ults early and took the map.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Numbani : 4-3 Cats</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ETCetera showed off why he was picked 3rd overall by taking first point with 3 quick picks, and continued to play well throughout the map. Both teams looked very good on attack, but both teams were making major unforced errors on defense.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Dorado : 2-1 Cats</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Cats were stifled on attack, with Strud3l playing Brig very well on 2nd point defense and even threw in a PotG. However, after capturing quickly on first point, the O-Teas stagnated on second point and weren’t able to get anything going. At this point, the momentum was entirely in the Cats favor.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Temple of Anubis : 4-3 O-Teas</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Cats continued to dominate early, and set a bristling time bank. The O-Teas got things together and fired back, capturing with plenty of time as well, even managing to beat the Cats timebank. On second attack, a heroic stand by RohR, RiddleDog, and Kabr27 on second point attack got them just over the bar to hold on and force map 5.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><li><p>Ilios : 2-0 O-Teas</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The O-Teas simply looked like the better team on Ilios, and although the Cats put some good fights together, the O-Teas took Ilios somewhat comfortably with some great tank play to round out the series win.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h1 class="center" style="color: maroon;">Team of the Week</h1>

<p class="center notice"><em>Welcome to the first edition of Team of the Week. The Team of the Week will feature 7 players who contributed to their team in key ways. As a normal Gopherwatch team consists of at least 7 players, so will the Team of the Week, with a minimum of 2 tanks, dps, and supports, with one extra player of any role. The goal of Team of the Week is to highlight performances each week of players throughout the league that match MVP doesn’t quite accomplish. With that being said, our first Team of the Week shows off 2 tanks, 3 dps, and 2 supports.</em></p>

<h3>Tank : PurpleJesus - Pokhara Pusheens</h3>
<p>Our first entry goes to PurpleJesus. In his debut return to Overwatch after an illustrious Valorant career, there were allegations that PJ was “washed”. The PurpleJesus believers were rewarded this week when he got a 6k shatter on his first map, and continued to dominate on Reinhardt on his signature PJ’s Row. He even had an insane PotG on Gibraltar on Ashe, killing a nanoblade and 2 others in a 3-1 series win and earning himself a match MVP to boot.</p>

<h3>Tank : TheNortLogic - Welsh Whales</h3>
<p>Playing against PurpleJesus, TheNortLogic was lights out on D.Va, literally. He ate 2 graviton surges on the Whales attacking push of King’s Row, and had a fight winning bomb to boot. His Winston play on Numbani earned him a PotG as well, and although the Whales dropped the match, Nort showed why he is one of the league’s most sought after off tanks.</h3>

<h3>Dps : Rohr - Arizona O-Teas</h3>
<p>Rohr finds himself on Team of the Week for a very specific clutch play. With the clock ticking down on Anubis, the O-Teas found themselves down 4-3, needing 37.4% in order to win and force a map 5. As the final fight unraveled, the Cats picked off 3 members of the O-Teas, leaving Rohr stranded behind enemy lines. Fortunately for him, the Cats were forced to trickle in, and with the help of his two teammates, Rohr and the O-Teas managed to pick off the defenders and capture the point in heroic fashion, forcing an eventual map 5 victory.</p>

<h3>Dps : FedoraMaster - Iceland Imps</h3>
<p>The Tenderizer is here folks. With his trusty meat mallet, Fedora put up some huge numbers on Lijiang Tower and King’s Row, in an eventual 3-0 sweep. With the turret causing problems for the Anglers while the rivet gun clicked heads, Fedora was mopping up for the 1st place Imps.</p>

<h3>Dps: Lol247 - Dorado Ducks</h3>
<p>Despite off-rolling onto DPS, Lol247 seemed completely in his element this week. His numerous opening picks onto the opposition set the tempo in favor of his teammates and managed to secure many close fights. Notably, his two massive picks onto the enemy flex support and main tank during the Ducks’ overtime hold on Havana turned the tides of a seemingly unwinnable fight, leading to a close map victory. Overall, his sneaky 2k Hollywood dragon strike and dominant damage numbers proved that Lol247 is capable of both clutching lost fights and being an incredibly reliable and consistent DPS. </p>

<h3>Support: Bunny - Troubling Trout</h3>
<p>With Zukini out, the Trout found themselves in some trouble, down their primary Ana player. Bunny stepped up for the team in this manner, playing Ana on multiple maps, on a controller. I would never in a million years attempt this one at home folks, as Ana is the hardest support mechanically to play without aim assist, and probably the hardest to play even with aim assist. However, Bunny managed to make it work, and led the lobby in healing on Eichenwalde on Ana, negating a staggering 32% of her team’s damage taken.</p>

<h3>Support: Charbotron - Iceland Imps</h3>
<p>For a support performance this week, let’s talk about outperforming expectations. The synergy with her Nekos teammate Trey was highlighted with her utilization of speed boost whenever he went for aggressive plays, all while managing to outheal the opposition by a considerable margin. Charbotron’s low sr allows the team to run very high sr lineups, but when she plays as solidly as that, it’s hard to find a weakness in the team.</p>

<h1 class="center" style="color: maroon;">Power Rankings Week 1</h1>
<p class="center notice">After seeing our first week of matches, we have quite a few big movers, with one team moving an entire 9 spots. Getting some actual footage on how these teams will perform against other GWL teams gives us a much better grasp on what their strengths and weaknesses are, what gaps they need to fill, and what comps they look comfortable in. We also saw a new number one team, and a few teams who were low on our power rankings took home the W in week one. With the matches finally starting and more evidence to support our list, this power rankings was done by only the core journalism crew this time, as less input was needed, resulting in some big swings for some teams. Without further ado, let’s introduce our new number one... </p>

<h3>Iceland Imps</h3>
<p>After the draft, I had this team penned as the strongest looking team on my own power rankings, and after the first match against the collective favorites, the Awesome Anglers, I’m feeling pretty good about this team’s chances. Trey had arguably the best draft, managing to pick up his intended core of Zeus and FedoraMaster a round later than planned, while still managing to grab Invictus first round. During the match, Trey was putting on a highlight reel with a huge window fire strike, set up by Zeus, that finished off Lijiang Tower. Fedora was a walking ballista, putting out huge chunks of damage, and setting up Invictus to clean house. Nashbrowns looked stellar in his debut, slotting in nicely as the team’s go-to off tank. War got to show off his Lucio on Lijiang Tower and looked solid, while Charbotron put in work on King’s Row. Overall, this looks like the team to beat after week one, but we have another 1 vs 3 matchup this week, as the Imps take on the Pusheens.</p>

<h3>Ema Skies</h3>
<p>The Ema Skies seem to be vying to prove themselves as a high-tier team this season, beginning with their 3-1 victory over the Troubling Trout. There is no denying the dominant synergy coming from former St. Michael Hawks teammates Hvsek, Razzmatazz, Wytherin, and Fancy, all of whom let their experience show in their well-honed team play and clean ult combos. In addition to flashy plays like Jack’s massive EMP on Rialto and Fancy’s Wrecking Ball heroics, the Skies’ success came from their creative lineups. Finding value in their team’s flexibility, the Skies were able to field stacked lineups like the absolutely menacing Akua/Fancy tank line and Hvsek/Wytherin support duo. Even when off-roling, team members Razzmatazz and Jack had clutch moments on Pharah and Reinhardt respectively, proving that the Ema Skies can really do it all. Their lineups this week were unexpected to say the least, leaving us to wonder: what will the Ema Skies play next week? Who knows--perhaps this team’s strength lies within the element of surprise! :D</p>

<h3>Pokhara Pusheens</h3>
<p>The Pusheens moved up 5 spots from the preseason power rankings, showing that old dogs can learn new tricks. The bralic Captain PurpleJesus put on a show on both Tank and Dps surprisingly. Nuttyr found an exciting life on the Support after transferring to mouse and keyboard. Nqthyn completed the task, looking quite suspicious coming in from Season 5 but proved his place on both Dps and Tank, pairing well with both Mikey and Ribro. The first week of the season PurpleJesus (Boonie) sent to me, a Mikey with a Mercy! Bronx showed out on Moira and yes, Mercy. With many team comps in their arsenal they definitely deserve credit. </p>

<em>~Yeetmeister</em>

<h3>Dorado Ducks</h3>
<p>Like the Axolotls last season, Frobel decided that he was going to be able to get the most amount of value playing Roadhog after trying “real” compositions for all of one half of one round of Lijiang Tower. It probably didn’t help that Nyamonya’s ISP decided they were a Phrogs Phan, spiking to 9000 in some crucial moments. Lol247 and Jumbled did much better than expected on a DPS off-role, holding their own in a lot of these scrappy fights. They also managed to C9 first point Havana in OT but still managed to hold Havana 1st for over 4 minutes to win the map on their way to a map 5 victory. The Ducks decided to take a comfort pick approach, which made them look good and in their element even in the chaos that was this match. They went into the Phrog Zone and managed to make it out alive with their first victory of the season and hope to repeat their success against the #2 Ema Skies next week.</p>

<em>~ Rusty</em>

<h3>Welsh Whales</h3> 
<p>Moving up 2 spots in the power rankings, it seems like the Whales are stronger than we anticipated. There is still some experimentation with the Tanks on the team. With TheNortLogic flipping between Main Tank and Off Tank, depending on who his other tank is, whether it be Corey or Centurion. Centurion prefers the Off Tank in the relationship, while Corey likes to flip between playing Main Tank and Off Tank depending on which way the wind is blowing. Once the tank line is figured out, the Whales should be able to get used to playing a certain style with a consistent Main Tank or Off Tank player. While GrigmaMale is in his signature “GrigmaMale Spots” on the flank, the steady support line of Spacemuffin, Neopaladious, and ManiaMoon look to be able to keep their front line up with everything they can. Going into this next week, we should be able to see if they have built more synergy with the tank players as they face a possibly underrated Troubling Trouts, hopefully without any ringers.</p>

<em>~ RiddleDog</em>

<h3>Arizona O-Teas</h3>
</p>When it comes to off-role value, the Arizona O-Teas give the Ema Skies a run for their money. With some of the most incomprehensible team comps all week, the Arizona O-Teas were able to eke out a 3-2 victory against the #9 Chicago Cats. The O-Teas put on an incredible show on Lijiang Tower, running a comfortable composition which featured most of their players on their main roles. Thanks to the consistent DPS line of RohR and LumpySeal and the 40% team damage healed by support player Strud3l, the O-Teas managed to win the second round of Lijiang 100-0. But each map that passed their lineup seemed to get stranger, and although they still found value in RustyGoomba’s incredible Brigitte and RiddleDog’s flashy Hanzo 3k dragon, what the O-Teas flaunted in clutch plays, they seem to lack in consistency. As time goes on, this team will hopefully get more experience playing with one another and building up synergy, and once the teamplay issues are ironed out, we could see them quickly become a high-tier team. Despite this, the O-Teas still managed a well-deserved win this week, as teammate Kabr27 showed up when his people needed him most, and RohR’s massive tactical visor placed the last nail in the Anubis coffin. Overall, the Arizona O-Teas seem full of exciting, clutch plays, and boast what we can only imagine are some of the loudest comms of the whole league. </p>

<h3>Phiji Phrogs</h3>
<p>This team made it close against the Dorado Ducks, who look to be a pretty respectable team in their own right. With that being said, this team still has some question marks to it, as getting everyone on their main roles isn’t possible, as the team has a few too many frogs. With 3 Lucio mains on the team, one will always have to flex support while another is subbed out. It was clear that the Phrogs tried to organize in an effective manner on Sunday, but we don’t think that’s where their strength lies. This team, with both Wags and Phrog, should thrive on the chaos, but it didn’t seem like they exactly did against the Ducks, another scrappy team, when the Roadhog mirrors came out. Some great performances by Whalefish kept a lot of maps close when the team really needed it, and I’d look to see a lot more heroics from the chaos team as the season goes on.</p>

<em>~ Nuttyr</em>

<h3>Troubling Trout</h3>
<p>This team is very difficult to rank after Week 1, with Yeetmeister and ZUKINI not being able to make it to their game. Because of this, sonicronic had to ring on DPS for Yeetmeister and Orion had to run some comps that probably weren’t ideal. RektCactus had to play off tank while liftkey played DPS and bunny played Flex Support for the most part. With their full roster, Orion should be able to run comps that should theoretically be better than what he had to run this previous week. This would include liftkey on Off Tank with RektCactus and Yeetmeister on their main role of DPS. Despite the scuffed comp that was run, the Trout were still able to take King’s Row off of the Ema Skies, the 2nd highest rated team on this list. As they are facing the Welsh Whales this coming week, it will be interesting to see with their (hopefully) full roster if we rated the Trout too low here or if they are right where they belong.</p>

<em>~ RiddleDog</em>

<h3>Chicago Cats</h3>
<p>
The Cats came very close to taking home a 3-1 win to start their season, but a C9 on Anubis followed by an inability to finish off the final 3 O-Teas on the point led to an eventual map 5 defeat. The team had some pop off moments by ETCetera and Oks, but the theme of the series was not being able to close out fights when they need to, then overperforming once they’re down. It seems like this team is slowly figuring things out with the rotation, and this team should realistically get better as the season goes on, as they are built with a higher tank line than most teams. Once the team gets in sync with Oks and Cathect on engages, this team could be a solid contender. Until then, the Cats move up one spot but remain near the bottom for now.</p>

<em>~ Nuttyr</em>

<h3>Awesome Anglers</h3>
<p>The Anglers looked bad, nothing else to it. They looked like everyone was playing a different game compositionally and were playing split, tunnel visioning on different things. But they lost to the team we rated as the #1 team in this power rankings and still have good enough pieces to build a solid enough team. I think their biggest issue against the Imps was that their players were on unfamiliar characters within their role to try and benefit others on the team to no success. If they find a way to play a comp where each of their teammates is on a more comfortable character within their role I see a future where they can get an upset win (as much of an upset you can have with the second highest SR player in the league). They play against the O-Teas next week (oh hey my team) and look to bounce back against an easier opponent. </p>
