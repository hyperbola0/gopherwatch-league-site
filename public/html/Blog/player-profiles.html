<p>Hey everyone! Welcome to the launch of <del>Cyberpunk 2077</del> Player Profiles! This is a huge update and there are a lot of issues I will be working out over the next week. Since there's a lot to cover, let's get right into it!</p>

<h1>Player Profiles</h1>

<img class="blog-image-large" src="/images/Blog/player-profile-demo.png">

<p>This is the latest feature update to the website and gives each player their own profile page. These can be accessed throughout the site, including from team rosters, the stats page and draft pages. Players can view all their hero statistics in one place here, as well as add their own personal flair to the page. This includes adding their real name, pronouns, jersey number, hometown, degree, main role, favorite hero and bio. In addition, players can also upload an image to the page's header, whether that's a portrait, selfie, profile pic or something else. Players can also link their social media profiles on Twitch, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Reddit.</p>

<p>There are a few parts that need to be completed as well. The Accolades section is intended to show accomplishments within the league, including MVP awards, participation in all-star games, placing high in season/playoff rankings, and volunteering for the league in staff roles. In addition, player SRs are not displayed at this time. We will also allow players to display additional accounts they own in a future update.</p>

<p>If you want to add or update information for your profile, please fill out the google form for your information <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdv8Vmyolz_0in7b-qOp2tFnEB-4l6EEpilrWReRTRKrpBGzA/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. If you have a profile image you would like added to your page, send me (hyperbola0#1499) a DM through <a href="/Discord/">Discord</a>.</p>

<h1>Website Redesign</h1>

<p>As you may have noticed, the website looks a bit different. The navigation bar looks much cleaner and several parts of the website have been updated or are planned to be updated. For example, the team pages now use the team's color as a background. Note: I selected colors from the team icon that looked good; if captains would prefer a different color, send me a message and I can easily update it.</p>

<p>You may notice that some aspects of the site are harder to use due to the new darker background confilicting with old text colors. This will be updated soon to bring the site's contents in line with the newer design.</p>

<h1>Future Updates</h1>

<p>This website has gone through a lot of development to reach the point it is at, and should be in a good place after I complete the fixes outlined above. I believe that at this point all of the major functionality of the website is available and it is at least as good as the spreadsheet was (and hopefully a lot nicer to use).</p>

<p>However, given that it's been a few months of churning out new features the code behind it is a bit of a mess. I will likely spend most of the next few months cleaning it up and making the website easier to maintain. This should help a lot for Season 4, and hopefully it will be at the point where all that is needed is updating to new teams and a different spreadsheet. There may not be as exciting of updates from this point on, but know that I'm still hard at work preparing for future seasons!</p>
