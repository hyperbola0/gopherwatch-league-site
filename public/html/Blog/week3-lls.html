<p>Heading into the match between the London Lumberjackslams and Oceania Otters last night many, myself included, already had it going to the way of London. Looking
very strong so far this season with huge wins against the Rialto Rincewinds and a sweep against the Bendigo Bilbies while the Otters had yet to get anything in the
W column after a close map 5 loss to the Galapagos Gremlins. This match had even more on the line for the Lumberjackslams as they looked to solidify the #2 seed in our
tournament and potentially steal the #1 seed should they sweep.</p>
<p>Those hopes were quickly dashed as the Otters took a swift 2-0 victory on Busan, without even going to Meka Base where Wags can play the Doomfist that has given many teams
fits this year. This victory was off the back of great team play and a standout performance from the hitscan player Magna2 with some big high noons and clutch eliminations.
This made the Lumberjackslams look to shake things up as we moved onto King's Row and playing their brawl style with Treebeard subbing in on the Reinhardt. Dispite some flashes
from the Wags Doomfist and TheNortLogic feasting on the ultimates of the Lumberjackslams, the Otters crumbled at KrazyFlames impecable Zarya play, seemingly always 100 charge
and pumping out the damage into the frontline. Moving onto Havanna, we saw Jefe subbed in to play the Orisa and Reinhardt. We saw some interesting comps to say the least with
Genji making an appearance from Wags and even getting some blade kills. Even with a solid defense from the Lumberjackslams, holding the Otters on point b with solid team play
and high ground control, they were eventually full held on A due to the aggressive Reinhardt play from Jefe not allowing the DPS or supports to fully contribute.</p>
<p>Heading into Blizzard World, the Otters looked in control of the series. The one map they lost, King's Row, was very close and came down to the last fight whereas the maps they won were
in dominant fashion. However, this was not the case on Blizzard World. With their double bubble comp, the Lumberjackslams defense was unbreakable. Great tank play from both
KrazyFlames and RexActa, along with GoSeek having a standout performance on the Ana with anti-nades, sent the Otters packing after getting held on A. Map 5 was seemingly a coin
flip heading in with both teams having moments of excellence and pepegury. However, Lijiang Tower was in control of the Otters the whole time. Wags got to play the Doomfist
on Control Center and Night Market was in complete control of the Magna2 Symmetra. However, the real standout for me on this map was Yeetmeister, hitting some massive shatters
as well as holding back KrazyFlames aggression while maintaining space for their DPS to dominate. A quick 2-0 for the Otters and they claim their first win of the season.</p>
<p>My Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wags's Rookie of the Year campaign continues to look strong after another great performance. However, if he's not careful, he might lose it to the next person I'm about to speak on.</li>
	<li>This is two weeks in a row the Yeetmeister has taken it to very strong main tank opponents, especially in the Reinhardt battle, in BOON1E and KrazyFlames. Should this level of performance keep up, this sort of unknown name will become very well known around the league as a tank to be feared and respected on match day.</li>
	<li>KrazyFlames is proving this season that he is indeed worth the SR with the ability to play both the Main and Off tanks at a level unmatched by most. The Zarya is the stand out so far, aside from some questionable bubble timings in yesterdays match, but I expect these to be ironed out with more time on the team.</li>
	<li>The Otters are definetly a team to look out for in the upcoming tournament coming from the playins. Regardless of record, the Otters look to be a team on the rise taking it to map 5 the last 2 weeks against our #1 and #2 seeds. This can be due to the amount of time the team is putting into scrims and vod review (or TheNortLogic finally swapping to an Otter pfp, who knows really).</li>
