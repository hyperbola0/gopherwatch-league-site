<h3>1. Bendigo Bilbies</h3>

<p>The Bilbies are an extremely strong team with the meta is in a current spot that allows them to excel. With everyone able to play their comfort characters, the team was able to 3-0 in both their wins versus the Otters and the BBQs. Their only loss this season is to the London Lumberjack Slams, a troubling 3-0 that can be attributed to missing ashiftyfish, who looks to be a solid rock for the team in the support slot. With Khan and hvsek heading the dps charge and PapaTriste managing to land every shatter in the known universe, it looks as if the only thing that can stop this team is themselves. Going into their Week 4 match against the Djibouti Shorts, to say that a loss would be an upset would be a massive understatement. </p>

<h3>2. London Lumberjack Slams</h3>

<p>This team was primed to be first following a close win over the Rincewinds and a 3-0 stomp of the Bilbies, but following their Map 5 loss to the Otters, this team couldn't make it to the top spot in the league. However, their tank play has been strong and the DPS line of Mikey and MommyMilker (yes that is a real player) they have looked extremely strong with solid support play from their rotation of Goseek, ImaPotatoz, and hyperbola0 (the website legend). They were even able to flash flexibility by playing Treebeard on the Reinhardt where we got to see exactly what gave him the Threebeard name. This is one of the teams that could see some slight issues due to the recent hitscan nerfs, but I'm sure that given time they will be able to adjust accordingly. This team has to hope that their loss to the Otters is a minor stomp, and not an event that stops their momentum heading into the Week 4 match versus the Wakanda BBQs.</p>

<h3>3. Galapagos Gremlins</h3>

<p>How is the only 3-0 team in Gopherwatch below 2 teams? Simpy put, their strength of schedule has been kind to them early. After Week 4, they will have played 3 of the bottom 4 teams in this power ranking. Not to say that they haven't looked extremely strong in those matches, because they've stomped, but it may be a few weeks before we get an accurate read on where to put them compared to the other teams in the top half of this list. The tankline of Boom1011 and BOON1E are about as strong as they come in the league, second only to the Rialto Rincewinds, but their biggest strength so far has been huge value from their DPS player BigDog (formerly Adapt from Ritto Raccoons) on mostly Flex DPS. With Artic as his dps partner, and a support line of tranc, Zeus, and GeminoCurse that doesn't seem to ever actually die (biased), this team doesn't seem to have a real hole in their lineup. Look for them to try and maintain their perfect record through Week 4 against The Tenochtitlan Tacos.</p>

<h3>4. Rialto Rincewinds</h3>

<p>Yes this team is 1-2, but they have yet to play an actual roster. In Week 1, the London Lumberjack Slams needed to run a slightly over SR cap roster (pre-approved) and they took them to Map 5. In Week 2, they lost Frobel to an internet issue, causing them to try and put together a rag tag team of offroles that went to another Map 5 loss to the Wakanda BBQs, who had a DPS ringer due to scheduling issues for the series. In Week 3, they secured their first win, a 3-0 stomp of the Djibouti Shorts that was missing their offtank player and shotcaller. So why this high? The tankline. Bonezee and Orion have been trying to be on the same team since Season 1 and with good reason, they roll. Their Pizza Pirates synergy has been able to carry many fights in the league this year even when they look to be at their weakest. MMatthew and LostSilver have seen their value blossom as they've settled into their roles in the team while Centurion and Frobel have been flexible in their roles to help guide the team to victory. The true test for them will be their Week 5 match against the Galapagos Gremlins, but they will first have to go against the Gaming Golems in Week 4.</p>

<h3>5. Oceania Otters</h3>

<p>The Oceania Otters had about as rough of a start to the season as you could have got. Using this power rankings list, they faced all 3 of the team teams in their first 3 weeks and managed to get a win over the Lumberjack Slams. Many thought that Jefe and TheNortLogic would have been the starting tank tandem but unluckily for Jefe he finds himself back in Lucio Jail as Yeetmeister has shined on the Reinhardt. Magna and Ȃssquatch (no relation to MommyMilker) have shaped themselves as confident DPS players (Ȃssquatch even won over the Rincewinds when filling for the BBQs) while Kden and Zelos have been able to keep everyone alive and keep the machine up and running. Their biggest problem has been winning on "non-Reinhardt" maps where the inability to contest high grounds has been a bit rough for them. The team plays the PMAs in Week 4 and if there was anyone in the league I would trust to play D.va against them, it would be TheNortLogic. Look at this team to try and carry their momentum after a tough start to the season against the Plymouth PMAs.</p>

<h3>6. Wakanda BBQs</h3>

<p>This team is hard to rank. They've gotten wins over the Tenochtitlan Tacos and the Rialto Rincewinds, but got 3-0'd by the Bendigo Bilbies. They clearly have a good team, with BBQ patching a hole with a preseason trade, receiving Thicckqboi to play offtank. The team boasts a proclivity of random double offtank compositions to go along with their DPS duo of... Valorant players? Jokes aside, this team is very mechanically skilled with Cathect, RazzMaTazz, and Riddledog being a top tier support line. With the Week 4 match being against the London Lumberjack Slams, we're likely to see a solid game with at least a little bit of trolling.</p>

<h3>7. Gaming Golems</h3>

<p>This team has something to prove, with a Map 5 win over the Plymouth PMAs and a 3-1 win over the Tenochtitlan Tacos it's clear that their 2-1 record may not be the most impressive in the league. Still, with a solid tankline Potateau (UnbindShift) being unable to get shattered and RustyGoomba sharing his ice cream cone with the enemy DPS players, they've been able to gather their wins in series where they may be mechanically outpaced at the current moment. ÜberZerker (ÜberZeker?) and Strud3l have been key parts to this team, as they adapt to their offroles they've been able to look stronger each week. With a support platoon of LlamaKking and G1iTcH (I don't think there's specific reason why either of them play, I think they just both deserve playtime) and a flexible HarChar, the team looks to be at the very least a solid gatekeeper in the middle of the rankings. Going into the next 3 weeks, they face the Rialto Rincewinds, Bendigo Bilbies, and the London Lumberjack Slams, yikes! Their Week 4 match against the Rialto Rincewinds may be their best shot for a while.</p>

<h3>8. Plymouth PMAs</h3>

<p>The PMAs share a theme with the team just below them, their only win is over the Djibouti Shorts and they lost to the Gaming Golems just above them. They went to the only Map 6 that this league has seen this year on the back of ecrim coming in as one of the top Echo's in the league. Following a trade sending Thicckqboi to the BBQs and receiving Marty, they decided their tank strategy would be to put top Hitscan player Invictus on Main Tank. Even more questionable has been their decision to play him on Reinhardt with Lucio-less compositions as they (reasonably) opt to use Boschy on Mercy to pocket ecrim. But thekraken has been known in the past for being a positive influence (hence the PMAs) and a shotcaller so give it some time and they may be able to clean up their questionable compositions and allow the DPS line of ecrim and maple to thrive going into their match against the Oceania Otters</p>

<h3>9. The Tenochtitlan Tacos</h3>

<p>Not just any Tenochtitlan Tacos, The Tenochtitlan Tacos. This is a team that going into Week 4 may be harder to judge, as they are losing TMI mid season to prior engagements and are relying on rookie free agent aquisition Sky (2758 Offtank, 2901 Flex DPS) to fill the spot that was formerly occupied by a taco following a meme trade. The team has many aspects that look strong, such as (Hall of Famer) RohR on tank and ShadowBluJay on dps. But I can't help feel like they're underperforming their SR a bit with Guku being put on a DPS offrole that he hasn't looked super comfortable with to start the season, but is looking up a bit more as time has gone on. Can't say anything about the support line except they seem to be on a bit of a different page than the rest of their team sometimes resulting in some clutch moments that slip through the cracks. Their Week 4 match is against the Galapagos Gremlins. They should use it as an opportunity to try and fit their new free agent in to the lineup (maybe even secure a dub) and prepare for the Plymouth PMAs in Week 5.</p>

<h3>10. Djibouti Shorts</h3>

<p>This team may have the best name and logo in the entire league, but unfortunately the plan to build a squad similar to the Rats squad that got 1st in the regular season and lost in the grand finals isn't panning out quite as well as FlipFlop wanted. Aside from some questionable offroling, this team just doesn't seem to be on the same page. I don't know if it's a shotcalling issue, compositional issue, or if they're just straight up being counter comped but there's something wrong with team that needs to be fixed. They opted to waive their priority for the next wave of free agents and with matches against The Tenochtitlan Tacos and Plymouth PMAs behind them and Bendigo Bilbies and London Lumberjack Slams matches in the next 2 weeks, it may be difficult for the Shorts to find a victory in the first half of the season, if at all. I'm crossing my fingers we don't have another Marties/Raccoons/Beebles situation.</p>
