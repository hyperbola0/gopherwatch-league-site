There was no match recap for Week 3 due to me deciding to put the time into this (and also the Fennecs and Syndromes not able to play until Saturday the week after) so I hope that this works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Understandably the Preseason Power Rankings that I said had almost no value and to a degree I was right but they did hold up better than I thought they would. Using them correctly predicted 9 out of the 15 matches which is much better than I thought they would be. But the preseason doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore because the games were played so let&rsquo;s see who the biggest winners and losers were in the first third of the season. Another thing I want to note is that the Power Rankings were initially made on the roles that the players were picked for rather than the roles they would play to fit within the SR cap because I wasn&rsquo;t gonna do all that math. These ones should more accurately reflect the skills of the teams.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Disclaimer: Due to a midterm and homework this week I was not able to watch these matches (that I didn&rsquo;t play in):</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c9">Falkland Fennecs</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;vs. </span><span class="c11 c6">Galactic Water Bears</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;| Week 2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c10">Honey Bunches of Oks</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;vs. </span><span class="c6 c8">Highland Hydro Homies</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;| Week 3</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">Galactic Water Bears</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;vs. </span><span class="c4">Bengali Boom!</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;| Week 3<br></span><span class="c6 c14">Stockholm Syndromes</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;vs. </span><span class="c6 c9">Falkland Fennecs</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;| Week 3</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Format is as follows:<br>Power Ranking - Team | Record | Map Differential | Preseason Power Ranking</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#1 Pompeii Pelicans | 3-0 | +6 | </span><span class="c3 c5">&#11014;</span><span class="c0">1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I rated this team very highly in the preseason and they did not disappoint. In a Rush/Brawl dominated GWL meta the Pelicans see their best performance with the Pizza Pirates main tank Assquatch playing (mostly) Orisa. This team looks to be a dominant powerhouse with roster depth that allows them to play a powerful squad with every player getting solid amounts of playtime and they are the team to beat going forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#2 Highland Hydro Homies | 2-1 | +3 | </span><span class="c3 c13">&#11015;</span><span class="c0">1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This team has played 3 games against teams from each &ldquo;tier&rdquo; of this power rankings. They lost to only the team above them and haven&rsquo;t shown any signs of slowing down for this season. The team has roster depth to fight anyone in the league and though they got reverse swept by the Pelicans, then not having completely collapsed from it shows they&rsquo;re strong enough to stay up here for the foreseeable future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#3 Stockholm Syndromes | 2-1 | &plusmn;0 | </span><span class="c3 c5">&#11014;</span><span class="c0">6</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t know why I underrated this team so much, maybe I thought more Bastion would be played. Jokes aside, this team, like the teams above them, have good roster depth to get everyone play time with no issues. They&rsquo;re only loss is to the Pelicans like the Hydro Homies, but unlike the Hydro Homies, the team relies more on team play and struggles a bit to clutch out some fights</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#4 Singapore Seekers | 1-2 | -2 | </span><span class="c3 c13">&#11015;</span><span class="c0">1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They lost the Jackalopes in Week 1 due to compositional differences, then lost to the Pelicans in a fairly close series. They like running more Wrecking Ball compositions, which if the coordination tunes up allows them to effectively counter the Rush/Brawl meta that permeates throughout GWL with heavy carry potential from Mikey and RohR. They may not have the cleanest losses, but I think that they have too high of a ceiling for me to drop them too far down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#5 Falkland Fennecs | 1-2 | -1 | </span><span class="c3 c12">-</span><span class="c0">0</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, this is probably the team I understand the least. Having missed approximately &frac12; of their playtime, the only thing that has been constant is a flanking BBQ ravaging the enemy backline on various characters and it&rsquo;s working. This team was also the dickhead team to @ me after their first win so they don&rsquo;t get anything else written about them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#6 Galactic Water Bears | 2-1 | +2 | </span><span class="c3 c13">&#11015;</span><span class="c0">2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Putting the Galactic Water Bears this low does seem like I may be underselling the team a bit, but their loss to the Fennecs and Map 5 series against the Bengali Boom on paper worry me about this team. This is another team where I wasn&rsquo;t able to watch &frac12; of their matches, so they are another team I am unable to form a valuable opinion on. With the core of this team, they should be an incredible team but the scoreboards say I may have oversold them a bit in the preseason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Decent Teams</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#7 USSR Unicorns | 2-1 | +2 | </span><span class="c3 c12">-</span><span class="c0">0</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Honestly this team really isn&rsquo;t that bad but it&rsquo;s another team where their placement is based around the outcome of some of their matches. While I am biased and salty about getting 3-0&rsquo;d by them, the PurpleJesus diff has not been as strong as this team probably wants to be. However Whalefish </span><span class="c6">has</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;been able to pick up any slack with huge clutch potential when the momentum rolls in their favor. They&rsquo;re definitely looking better than I thought for them in the preseason, but so have all of the teams above them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#8 Bengali Boom | 1-2 | +1 | </span><span class="c3 c5">&#11014;</span><span class="c0">2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I got some messages about how I underrated this team, and given that they&rsquo;re not last I clearly did. Jokes aside, the Boom have just had trouble closing out series, as both of their losses come from Map 5 thrillers. Jack has made his case known for Rookie of the Year with a red hot start in some otherwise disappointing outcomes for the team. They&rsquo;re 3-0 victory over the Honey Bunches of Oks show that they&rsquo;re clearly not a bad team, but given how hard their schedule is for the next two weeks, it may be difficult to find a win until after the midseason tournament.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#9 Jericho Jackalopes | 1-2 | -3 | </span><span class="c3 c13">&#11015;</span><span class="c0">3</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This team managed to upset the Singapore Seekers but notably has shown difficulty in the Reinhardt matchups of all things, going to Map 5 against the Stockholm Syndromes and losing 3-0 to the USSR Unicorns due to them missing at least one player for the entire series and needing to call on a ringer. My bias is likely negatively affecting the ranking of this team as I don&rsquo;t want to overrate them, but after another ringer situation in an unlisted Week 4 game resulted in a 0-3 loss to the Galactic Water Bears, it may be difficult to sculpt out a win until playoffs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">#10 Honey Bunches of Oks | 0-3 | -8 | </span><span class="c3 c13">&#11015;</span><span class="c0">2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I like almost everyone on this team, but between the offroling and the low average SR, the Oks have had many difficulties this season finding a victory. The bright side for them is that I think they&rsquo;re figuring out their compositions a bit more as time goes on, notching a map win off the Hydro Homies. For now though, they hold the unfortunate spot of nowhere but up for this edition of the Power Rankings</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Plan for another one of these after the Midseason tournament (before Week 6) and good luck to every team here. GL to everyone and I can&rsquo;t wait to see which teams make it into the Midseason tournament in a couple weeks!</span></p></body></html>
