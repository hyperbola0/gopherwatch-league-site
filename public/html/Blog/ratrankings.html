<p>Welcome to the very first and probably only Rat Power Rankings. A continuation of the admin power rankings, due to extenuating circumstances there was not enough information to properly rank the teams so we’re gonna try something. I asked avid viewers that watched the games to help me make power rankings. I got FedoraMaster and FlipFlop (with a dash of scuf prod master pownlongbow). I’m sure this will go swimmingly.</p>

<p>These power rankings are made with the matches that have been played since we’re reaching the end of the season. This does not take into account the Free Agent signings listed above so please keep that in mind.</p>

<h3>1. Bendigo Bilbies | 6-1 | [Week 3: 1st]</h3>

<p>The spookiest of spooky teams also happens to be the team with the cutest of mascots. This team remains our number one in the power rankings due to the silent but deadly DPS combo of Hvsek and the legendary Khanzo. That being said, the rest of the team is nothing to scoff at. The Bileebles remain the one team that has not picked up a free agent or traded any of their players away, and they have shown that they really don’t need to. Week after week this team has absolutely rolled their competition, with a few close matches in the Djibouti Shorts and the Gaming Golems, but even still this team triumphed and asserted their dominance, establishing themselves as the number one, not just in our rankings, but league standings as well. Truly a spooky team.</p>

<h3>2. Oceania Otters | 4-3 | [Week 3: 5th]</h3>

<p>The Oceania Otters don’t seem to have any weak links on their roster. They have very strong team coordination, have great synergy, but also have individual carry players on some maps, such as Assquatch on Doomfist, TheNortLogic on D.Va, and Magna2 on [hero that looks like a cowboy]. That being said, I still want to see better showings from them on maps where these three heroes are not able to be played as effectively as others, or maps where they do not run these comps. However, the individuals on this team have a lot of prior team experience, and something happened after week two where they pulled it together and have not lost a match since. Speaking as someone who has played with Assquatch in a team environment, he can be infectious with his callouts and positivity even when the outlook seems grim. Clean comms combined with the potential of one of the best off-tank players in the league to shut down carry DPS on teams such as the Bendigo Bilbies and maybe the Plymouth PMAs, I think that this team can go deep into the playoffs.</p>

<h3>3. Gaming Golems | 5-2 | [Week 3: 7th]</h3>

<p>The power of the Golems is seen in the team’s coordination. The power of moving as a full six-man unit led them to great victories in the recent weeks. With the pick of the Frog God Himself, the team only looks to be getting better as the playoffs become nearer. With two big brain and vocal leaders in the Frog God and the Rat Captain, the team’s overall coordination seems unstoppable even when they only run a single team comp.</p>

<h3>4. The Tenochitlan Tacos | 4-3 | [Week 3: 9th]</h3>

<p>The Tenochitlan Tacos may be the weirdest team for me to talk about. They (with Assquatch as a ringer) were the team that finalized the Rialto Rincewinds’ retirement yet they were the team that I’ve seen the least gameplay from. They also lost a Map 5 series to the Oceania Otters so their placement reflects on both of those wins. Other than that they haven’t faced any of the mid table teams since the beginning of the season so it’s pretty hard to measure them as any lower or higher than that. The problems I previously described in the team are gone as they’ve picked it up. Following a free agent pickup of Sky just to flip them for L4MP “Bot Taco” SH4DE it looked to be a bit of a questionable decision but after these 2 series it’s hard to call it a downgrade. The team still has a good outlook as they’ve managed to clutch huge fights due to star players like ShadowBluJay and RohR and with a game against the Bendigo Bilbies coming up depending on their performance they could become a standout team for playoffs.</p>

<h3>5. Wakanda BBQs | 3-3 | [Week 3: 6th]</h3>

<p>BBQ’s, BBQ’s, BBQ’s… This team has seen a lot of changes in the past few weeks, trading essentially half of the original roster away in a series of two person trades to both the Galapagos Gremlins, trading away RazzMaTazz and free agent pick up pAiGe for Zeus, and the London Lumberjack Slams, trading both dps players Kobalt and Corey in exchange for the first overall pick of the draft, Mikey, and the standout platinum ana player, Goseek. After the recent addition of these pickups we saw a 3-0 win over the Djibouti Shorts and also a 3-1 loss to the Gaming Golems, so it makes it very hard to place this team. The weekly trades means that this team has lost a lot of that synergy that they have built up over the past few months and instead are stuck back at square one with a whole new team, leading to a lot of inconsistencies match to match. That is something that can only come with time, and there are not a lot of weeks left before playoffs. That being said, the skills of these players individually do prove to be effective and an upgrade from what they previously had, all this team needs is a little bit of time and they could prove to be one of the best in the league.</p>

<h3>6. Djibouti Shorts | 2-5 | [Week 3: 10th]</h3>

<p>This team has really come to perform as a solid mid table team following the pickup of NinjaDrew10 to play support. Let it be known that this team has been willing to try some unorthodox role swaps to mitigate some of their worse maps, namely known Torbjorn enthusiast FedoraMaster playing an Ana on Junkertown among others. If this team can keep the mental together and keep up a bit more of a unit they could shoot up come playoffs given their past showcases of peak brilliance, notably a Map 5 series against the #1 ranked Bendigo Bilbies in Week 4.</p>

<h3>7. Galapagos Gremlins | 4-2 | [Week 3: 3rd]</h3>

<p>Hands down the biggest enemy of this team is their own availability, they lose Boom1011 for the remainder of the regular season and BigDog has been hit or miss on being able to show up. Trey and Season 1 MVP BOON1E have been doing well but lack of practice combined with some hard teams to play has made things a bit hard for them the last few weeks, losing to the Rialto Rincewinds (RIP), The Tenochitlan Tacos, and the Bendigo Bilbies. The team has a lot of upside so if they can either slot Marty in on Tank effectively or otherwise look for a free agent to fill that slot this team could still move up with matches against other mid table teams on the horizon or fall further with a London Lumberjack Slams match 2 weeks in the making on Thursday.</p>

<h3>8. Plymouth PMAs | 1-5 | [Week 3: 8th]</h3>

<p>This team seemed like losing ecrim to inactivity to be completely lost but they’ve managed to find akua089TAS (just a great name to commentate I’m sure) as a bright spot to take his place. The lack of a true main tank player still hurts this team a bit as they still are doing some role shifting to figure things out but the team could be a sneaky upset team come the playoffs especially with the free agent window breathing down my spine as I write this.</p>

<h3>9. London Lumberjack Slams | 1-5 | [Week 3: 2nd]</h3>

<p>The Slams seem a bit stuck after their impressive start. Currently on a four-match losing streak, the team looks to turn it around against a Boom-less Galapagos Gremlins. With strong players and leaders in KrazyFlames, Corey, and Kobalt the team looks like they have the tools needed to turn this season around as the regular seasons ends. Value picks like that of MM and Treebeard also allows the team to run more higher ranked players without giving too much up in other roles. The addition of the free agent of pushiin also allows the team a bit more fixability in the support role for a pretty good SR value.</p>

<p>With the ban of RexActa, it’s hard to judge the outlook of this team going into the end of the season and the playoffs following given his prevalence in the roster in previous matches.</p>

<h3>10. Rialto Rincewinds | Disbanded | [Week 3: 4th]</h3>

<p>Really tragic to see this team go, they started looking strong but following player burnout the team felt it better to let their players find other opportunities leading up to playoffs than play on a team falling apart. They performed well and I’m sure everyone is excited to see where the players from this team go as the summer season comes to a close. o7 soldiers</p>
