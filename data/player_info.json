As a masters average team including some of the leagues&apos; notable players (oks, Mikey, EtCetera, Marty, Strud3l, ImaPotatoz), they reached Tespa&apos;s top 32 Spring 2020 by a combination of a lot of luck (opponent drop outs) and team synergy. In Fall 2020, RohR would coach and sub for the Calzone Crusaders before joining the Pizza Pirates as main tank for Spring 2021. Now, RohR enjoys his time on the farm working on his coaching and analytics skillsets while participating in the league.\n\nIn the season 1 of the Gopherwatch League, RohR played primarily the Wrecking Ball hero for the meme team, the Galapagos Gremlins, a team said to be unbeatable on control points. In season 2, RohR stepped back from the tank role to try out playing dps and support for the Ritto Raccoons. Although they never achieved a decisive victory, they took a number of teams to some close map fives. This season, RohR has returned to the main tank stage to put on display the power of science as main tank for the Tenochitlan Tacos, joined by former Raccoons and Pirates teammate Guku.\n"},{"battletag":"RustyGoomba#1483","teams":"Quebec Quokkas\nJericho Jackalopes\nGaming Golems","mvp":"0","tank":"3982","dps":"3604","support":"3947","realname":"Reilly Fogler","playernumber":"33","pronouns":"He/Him/His","hometown":"Bloomington","major":"Statistics","twitch":"https://www.twitch.tv/rustygoomba","twitter":"https://www.twitter.com/rustygoomba","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXNF9uVUtZTU5iq8jPC7Fw","instagram":"","reddit":"","role":"Tank","hero":"Winston","picture":"/images/playerportraits/goombfuck2.png","bio":"Likes monkey but will probably never play him.

RohR joined the UMN Overwatch community as captain for the Burrito Bandits in Fall 2019 as a second year PhD student. As a masters average team including some of the leagues&apos; notable players (oks, Mikey, EtCetera, Marty, Strud3l, ImaPotatoz), they reached Tespa&apos;s top 32 Spring 2020 by a combination of a lot of luck (opponent drop outs) and team synergy. In Fall 2020, RohR would coach and sub for the Calzone Crusaders before joining the Pizza Pirates as main tank for Spring 2021. Now, RohR enjoys his time on the farm working on his coaching and analytics skillsets while participating in the league.\n\nIn the season 1 of the Gopherwatch League, RohR played primarily the Wrecking Ball hero for the meme team, the Galapagos Gremlins, a team said to be unbeatable on control points. In season 2, RohR stepped back from the tank role to try out playing dps and support for the Ritto Raccoons. Although they never achieved a decisive victory, they took a number of teams to some close map fives. This season, RohR has returned to the main tank stage to put on display the power of science as main tank for the Tenochitlan Tacos, joined by former Raccoons and Pirates teammate Guku.\n","tankLastUpdated":"Season 4","dpsLastUpdated":"Season 4","supportLastUpdated":"Season 4"},{"teams":"Singapore
