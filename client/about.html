		<p class="text">
			The Gopherwatch League is an intramural league that started in late Spring 2020 as an offshoot of Esports @ UMN's Overwatch team. 
			At the time, the club participated in the tournaments run by Tespa (now Overwatch Collegiate). These tournaments would be difficult
			for lower ranked teams, as it would take most of the season to match against even teams. We made the Gopherwatch League to allow players
			of all ranks to compete, using an team SR cap based on the starting SR of each player. This encourages team captains to help coach
			their lower ranked players to gain value beyond the SR they began at. It also allows players from all ELO to interact and play together,
			which was rarer under the Tespa teams that play on teams based on rank. 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="center section-header">How it works</h1>
		
		<p class="text">	Seasons run every fall, spring and summer for roughly 10 weeks.</p> 
		<ul class="text">
			<li><p>In the preseason, the administration sends a registration form to players, where they collect information such as accounts, SR, 
			player hero pools and availability. Based on this information the team SR cap, number of teams and captains are determined. New players
			get to prove their mettle in a 2-3 hour combine, with captains and coaches scouting for potential talent. The players are then drafted onto
			each team in a livestreamed draft. This can vary depending on the range of SRs captains encompass, but typically the draft is in the form of
			a snake draft, starting with the lowest captain. </p></li>
			<li><p>After teams are formed, captains are given their match schedule which typically starts in 1-2 weeks. Players are given a small
			amount of time to scrim or queue together to establish synergy and team compositions. To encourage closer matches and fostering personal
			improvement, each viable team of six players has an SR cap on the average rating. This rating is typically set at slightly above the league's
			average SR.</p></li>
			<li><p>During the regular season, teams play one first-to-3 match each week with another team. The league also creates lots of good content to
			watch both here and on twitch, with things like power rankings, match recaps, and casted matches.</p></li>
			<li><p>After the season ends, teams take part in a postseason which consists of playin matches to reach an even number of teams and playoff
			matches in a single-elimination tournament. The winner of this tournament is crowned the champion of the season. Captains also nominate one
			player from their team for MVP, which is decided by a vote by players. There is also an all-star weekend event with fun games such as GOATS
			matches and widow tournaments, culminating in the first, second and third all-pro teams playing to determine the best players in the league.</p></li>
		</ul>
